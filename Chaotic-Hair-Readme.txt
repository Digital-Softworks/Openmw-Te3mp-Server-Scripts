Key Features of the Script:
List of Hair IDs:

The hairList variable contains the IDs of different hair objects from the Morrowind data files.
You should replace the placeholders with the actual hair IDs found in the Morrowind data (for example, b_n_dark_elf_m_hair_01, etc.).
Timer Function:

A timer is set to trigger the changePlayerHair function every 5 minutes (5 * 60 seconds).
The timer.real type is used, which means the timer will run in real-world time, not game time.
Player Hair Change:

The function tes3.setPlayerAppearance{hair = hair} changes the player's hair.
The function first finds the hair object based on the ID from the list, and if it's found, it applies the new hair model to the player.
Logging:

The script uses mwse.log to log the changes. These logs can help you monitor the hair changes and debug any potential issues by checking the MWSE.log or openmw.log files.
Steps to Use the Script:
Save the Script:

Save the Lua script as hair_changer.lua.
Place the Script:

Place the .lua script in the appropriate directory for OpenMW Lua scripts (usually Data Files/scripts or Data Files/MWSE/mods/yourmod/ for MWSE users).
Configure the OpenMW Settings:

If necessary, add the Lua script directory to the openmw.cfg file by adding:
kotlin
Copy code
data="C:/path_to_your_scripts_directory"
Launch OpenMW:

Start OpenMW (or MWSE-enabled Morrowind) and the script will run automatically, changing the playerâ€™s hair every 5 minutes.
How to Customize:
You can add more hair object IDs to the hairList array.
Adjust the hair change interval by modifying the hairChangeInterval variable (in seconds).
Notes:
Ensure the hair IDs you use exist in the game. You can use tools like the Construction Set or TES3Edit to find valid hair object IDs.
If using custom hair mods, ensure their IDs are registered properly in the game's data files.
